# easycontract
Winter semester of 2021, project at the HTW Berlin.

Collaborated in a team of 8 and 1 supervisor to create a web application for StartRight (https://www.start-right.de), a student legal advisor based in Munich.

### Tech Stack
The application was developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. We used GitLab as our version control system where we also had a Scrum board to track issues.
